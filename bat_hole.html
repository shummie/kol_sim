<h2>Level 4 Quest: The Bat Hole</h2>
<hr>

<p>
<b>Quest Description</b>
<hr>
The main goal of this quest is to defeat the boss bat in the Boss Bat's Lair.
<p>
The zone opens up as you either defeat screambats, or use sonar-in-a-biscuits which are dropped by various bats throughout the various sub zones.
<p>
Three zones need to be opened up in order to access The Boss Bat.
<p>
Using a ten-leaf clover in Guano Junction will yield 2 sonar-in-a-biscuits.
<p>
Along the way, you will also want to adventure in the Beanbat chamber to get an enchanted bean for the Level 10 quest.
<b>Analysis</b><hr>
<br>
For purposes of this analysis (for now) we assume that obtaining stench resistance is trivial. If in a Bad Moon run or low-skill HC run, see the bottom of the page for potential in-run sources of stench resistance.
<p>

To complete this zone, either screambats need to be encountered which are scheduled to appear every 7 turns, with the exception of the first at 8 turns since the counter is 0 indexed, or enough sonar-in-a-biscuits are found, which are dropped in the zone.

<p>
As a result, maximizing item-drops is the key to speeding up this zone.
<p>

<b>Superlikely</b><p>
The screambat is a superlikely combat encounter that appears every 7 turns (8 for first) across turns spent in the entire Bat Hole.
<p>

<b>Strategy</b><hr>

There are a myriad of ways to complete this quest. <br>

The following will be analyzed for this zone:
<ul>
    <li>Adventure normally. Get bean, then head to ratbat for sonar</li>
    <li>Clover for 2 sonars, get bean, then head to ratbat for sonar</li>
</ul>




The first subtask of this zone is to get access to the beanbat chamber. The enchanted bean will need to be obtained and is easy to cap with +100% item find.<br>

The following will be analyzed for this first subtask:
<ul>
<li>Clover for 2 sonars</li>
<li>Adventure until chamber is open</li>
</ul>

Running at a capped -25% Combat modifier is the main way to complete the quest as quickly as possible. <br>
With the fact that there exists a 5 turn delay on the appearance of the non-combat adventure, utilize free fights / runaways to reduce the delay counter in this zone. <br>
<i>Is this true? I can't remember the exact ways to burn delay anymore, do free runaways decrement the delay counter?</i>
<p>

<b>Simulation</b><hr>

<b>Assumptions:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Combat rate of 85%</li>
<li>Delay of 5 turns before the NC is available. This means it will appear at the earliest on your 6th adventure in the zone.</li>
<li>Superlikely appears after 7-8 turns with equal chance, randomly determined.</li>
</ul>
